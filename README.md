# Python-in-C-
Run python script using C#
This is simple script that uses C# to load python script. Here I am using a python script that import openCV and Mediapipe hand and pose library to track pose and hand movements and draw out the landmarks on output image using openCV.

This project is still ongoing. The script is meant to be a module to receive image frame from video stream for pre and post processing and outputinformation about pose and hand coordinates.
