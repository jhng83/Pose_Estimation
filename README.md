# Python-in-C-
Run python script using C#
This is simple script that uses C# to load python script. Here I am using a python script that import openCV and Mediapipe hand and pose library to track pose and hand movements and draw out the landmarks on output image using openCV.

Make sure to have the following environment configured before running your codes:

For Python:

ver 3.80 or below (you can create a virtual environment for this and add it to your anaconda environment, I use python 3.8.12)
The following version of the libraries need to be installed (remember to install it under the virtual environment)

#create environment
conda create --name myenv python=3.8.12
conda activate myenv

#install TensorFlow
conda install tensorflow=2.3.0

#install opencv
conda install opencv=4.0.1

#install mediapipe
pip install mediapipe==0.8.9.1

#install spyder
pip install spyder

#add the virtual environment to youe anaconda environment list after installing all the above library
conda config --add envs_dirs C:\Users\your_username\anaconda3\envs

#subsequently to use spyder in the next session, just activate the environment
conda activate myenv
#in the activated environment, launch spyder
spyder


For VS code:
Install the following from extension:
C# for Visual Studio Code
Python for VS code

Also install .NET SDK and add the directories to PATH variables
